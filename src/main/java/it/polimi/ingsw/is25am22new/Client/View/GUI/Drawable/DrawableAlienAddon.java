/**
 * The DrawableAlienAddon class represents a drawable component in the game
 * that depicts an alien-related enhancement or add-on. This class extends
 * the abstract DrawableComponentTile class and provides an implementation
 * for the draw method.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to visually represent alien-related
 * add-ons in the graphical user interface, such as additional
 * functionality or appearance for alien-themed components.
 *
 * Note: The current implementation of the draw method returns "null",
 * indicating that no specific drawing logic has been implemented.
 *
 * This class is part of the drawable component hierarchy, sharing
 * common traits and behavior defined in the superclass
 * DrawableComponentTile, which is utilized across various components
 * within the game.
